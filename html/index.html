  <p>Hello, I am Ellie my pronouns are she/her, I was born and raised in WA my whole life I'm a WA native my interests are listening to jazz, pop and r&b songs/music, makeup, watching my pet finches, reading books, my hobbies that help me grow are horseback riding, cooking classes, swimming at the gym, cooking and baking at home, and seeking to learn how to crochet and paint and draw. 

  at the moment I do not have any idea, clue or experience with IT programming, software programming, web development or computer science, I would like to be familiar to it. And feel comfortable web developing and I'm not tech savvy but I am hoping to gain the skills while passing this class and get the credits required to attain my degree for my future career :) that is what I would like to get out of this class. please no personal questions 

  love all

  god is good.</p>
